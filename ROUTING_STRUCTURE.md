# BakeProfit Routing Structure - Refactored ✅

## Overview

The bakery-business-tool has been refactored from a **single-page tab-based system** to a **proper sub-route system** with a shared layout component.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Before (Tab-Based)
```
/bakery-business-tool
  ├─ Sidebar (hardcoded in page.tsx)
  ├─ Header (hardcoded in page.tsx)
  └─ Tabs
      ├─ Dashboard
      ├─ Orders
      ├─ Recipes
      └─ ... (all in one page)
```

### After (Route-Based)
```
/bakery-business-tool/dashboard
  ├─ AppLayout (shared)
  │   ├─ Sidebar
  │   └─ Header
  └─ Dashboard component

/bakery-business-tool/orders
  ├─ AppLayout (shared)
  │   ├─ Sidebar
  │   └─ Header
  └─ OrderTracker component

/bakery-business-tool/recipes
  ├─ AppLayout (shared)
  │   ├─ Sidebar
  │   └─ Header
  └─ RecipeCalculator component
```

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. **AppLayout Component** (`components/AppLayout.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Shared layout with sidebar and header
- **Props**: 
  - `children` - Page content
  - `currentPage` - Current active page (for highlighting in sidebar)
- **Features**:
  - Responsive sidebar (mobile drawer)
  - Navigation with links to all routes
  - Header with page title
  - Logout button

### 2. **Individual Route Pages**
Each route page is now simple and focused:

```typescript
// Example: /bakery-business-tool/recipes/page.tsx
'use client'

import RecipeCalculator from '../components/RecipeCalculator'
import AppLayout from '../components/AppLayout'

export default function RecipesPage() {
  return (
    <AppLayout currentPage="recipes">
      <RecipeCalculator />
    </AppLayout>
  )
}
```

### 3. **Components Cleaned Up**
- Removed all tab/navigation logic from individual components
- Removed `onNavigate` props (no longer needed)
- Components now focus only on their functionality
- Much simpler and more reusable

### 4. **Main Page Redirect**
- `/bakery-business-tool` now redirects to `/bakery-business-tool/dashboard`
- Keeps SEO structured data for the root path
- Clean entry point

## 🔧 Adding a New Feature

To add a new feature (e.g., Reports):

1. **Create component** in `components/Reports.tsx`
2. **Create route** at `reports/page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   'use client'
   import Reports from '../components/Reports'
   import AppLayout from '../components/AppLayout'

   export default function ReportsPage() {
     return (
       <AppLayout currentPage="reports">
         <Reports />
       </AppLayout>
     )
   }
   ```
3. **Add to navigation** in `AppLayout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'reports',
     name: 'Reports',
     icon: <BarChart3 className="h-5 w-5" />,
     href: '/bakery-business-tool/reports',
   }
   ```

That's it! The new feature is automatically integrated.
