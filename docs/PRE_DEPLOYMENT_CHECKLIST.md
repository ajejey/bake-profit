## ⚠️ **MINOR POLISH (Optional Before Deployment):**

### **1. Date Formatting (Low Priority):**
Currently only Dashboard uses `formatDate()`. Apply to:
- OrderTracker - delivery dates
- RecipeCalculator - created/updated timestamps
- BusinessAnalytics - chart dates
- CustomerManagement - order dates

**Impact:** Low - dates still display, just not in user's preferred format
**Time:** 15-20 minutes

### **2. Cleanup Old Files:**
- `OrderTracker.old.tsx` - Can be deleted (backup file)

**Impact:** None - just cleanup
**Time:** 1 minute

### **3. Lint Warnings:**
Minor unused imports/variables in settings components:
- AccountSettings.tsx (Mail, Phone, Building2 icons unused)
- Various settings files have minor warnings

**Impact:** None - doesn't affect functionality
**Time:** 10 minutes to clean up
