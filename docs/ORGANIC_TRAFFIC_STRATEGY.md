## üéØ **PHASE 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2) - Implement in App**

### **1. Product-Led SEO (HIGHEST PRIORITY)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**What:** Build free tools/calculators that rank on Google and drive traffic.

**Why It Works:**
- Moz's Domain Authority checker drives millions of visitors
- Zapier grew from 1.6M to 10.6M organic visits using this strategy
- People search for "recipe cost calculator" - you ARE the solution

**Implement NOW:**

#### **A. Create Standalone Calculator Pages**
```
/tools/recipe-cost-calculator
/tools/bakery-profit-calculator  
/tools/pricing-calculator
/tools/ingredient-cost-calculator
/tools/batch-scaling-calculator
```

**Each tool should:**
- Work WITHOUT signup (free forever)
- Be fully functional
- Have "Upgrade for more features" CTA
- Be optimized for specific keywords
- Include schema markup for rich snippets

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Recipe Cost Calculator Page -->
<h1>Free Recipe Cost Calculator for Bakers</h1>
<p>Calculate your recipe costs instantly. Used by 10,000+ home bakers.</p>
[Interactive Calculator Here]
<button>Save & Track More Recipes (Free Signup)</button>
```

#### **B. Embed Widgets**
Create embeddable calculator widgets that other blogs can use:
```html
<script src="https://bakeprofit.com/widget/recipe-calculator.js"></script>

**Result:** Every blog that embeds = backlink + traffic
