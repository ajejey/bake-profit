# Authenticated User Redirect - Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

A reusable hook that automatically redirects authenticated users away from auth pages (login, signup, forgot-password, reset-password) to the dashboard.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

**Flow:**
1. User is already logged in (token + user in localStorage)
2. User tries to access `/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, or `/reset-password`
3. `useRedirectIfAuthenticated()` hook detects authenticated user
4. User is automatically redirected to `/bakery-business-tool`
5. User never sees the auth page

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Hook Code
```typescript
export function useRedirectIfAuthenticated() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { user, loading } = useAuth()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Don't redirect while loading
    if (loading) return

    // If user is authenticated, redirect to dashboard
    if (user) {
      router.push('/bakery-business-tool')
    }
  }, [user, loading, router])
}
```

### Usage
Simply call the hook at the top of any auth component:
```typescript
export default function LoginForm() {
  useRedirectIfAuthenticated()
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## ✨ Features

✅ **Automatic Redirect** - No manual checking needed  
✅ **Waits for Loading** - Doesn't redirect while auth state is loading  
✅ **Clean & Reusable** - Single hook for all auth pages  
✅ **No UI Flash** - Redirects before component renders  
✅ **Handles All Auth Pages** - Login, signup, forgot-password, reset-password

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Already Logged In
1. Login to app
2. Go to `/login`
3. Should redirect to `/bakery-business-tool` immediately
4. Should NOT see login form

### Test Scenario 2: Already Logged In - Forgot Password
1. Login to app
2. Go to `/forgot-password`
3. Should redirect to `/bakery-business-tool` immediately
4. Should NOT see forgot password form

### Test Scenario 3: Not Logged In
1. Logout (clear localStorage)
2. Go to `/login`
3. Should see login form normally
4. Should NOT redirect

### Test Scenario 4: Not Logged In - Reset Password
1. Logout (clear localStorage)
2. Go to `/reset-password?token=xxx&email=xxx`
3. Should see reset password form normally
4. Should NOT redirect

## 🔄 Auth State Flow

```
User visits /login
    ↓
useRedirectIfAuthenticated() called
    ↓
Check: Is user loading?
    ├─ YES → Wait, don't redirect
    └─ NO → Continue
    ↓
Check: Is user authenticated?
    ├─ YES → Redirect to /bakery-business-tool
    └─ NO → Show login form
```

## 📚 How to Use in New Auth Pages

If you add more auth pages in the future, just add this at the top:

```typescript
'use client'

import { useRedirectIfAuthenticated } from '@/hooks/useRedirectIfAuthenticated'

export default function MyAuthPage() {
  useRedirectIfAuthenticated()
  // ... rest of component
}
```

That's it! The redirect will work automatically.
